Paint app using PyGame. I worked with the limitations of the existing program, to add an extra small brush size, and a second row of selectable colors, and expanded the canvas to fit the extra palette options. Since positioning is fixed to the resolution, and not relative, care must be taken when adding new selectable elements to the palette menu. May add an Undo feature, at a later time.
